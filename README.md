### The Story

Kael Vance, a visionary entrepreneur, builds Solara Beach—a hyper-efficient, self-sufficient city-state on a pristine coastline. Its success and valuable beachfront attract the attention of the greedy and powerful Trident Maritime corporation.

When Trident's attempts at a corporate takeover fail, they resort to force, establishing a military blockade to seize the beach. Pushed to the brink, Kael must militarize his city's advanced civilian infrastructure—transforming construction drones, sea walls, and automated systems into a makeshift defense force.

His primary objective: achieve total **Beach Control**. This initial act of defiance to protect his home sparks a war, forging a new nation from a corporate enterprise and turning a brilliant CEO into a reluctant general.
